# MetlinkLiveApp

This app is an attempt to create something better than the current live-update applications available for Wellington's transportations service and something that makes use of the more interesting features available through the Metlink website's API.

It will feature a snappy refresh option for live stop information in both widget and app forms.
Stops will be locatable via map or selected quickly using the stop numbers
Bus locations and tracking, useful when meeting someone off a bus, will be available too.

# How it looks

The intended visual design, showing the three basic functions of the app are as follows. (note, these are mock images, the final result will differ slightly from these.

Viewing real time stop information for a particular stop
